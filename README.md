# School-Project-Maze-Solving
Enhanced version of a functional programming project to make a maze solver in Haskell.

To build : use 
```
ghc --make mazes -package Win32 -package mtl
```
(works on windows, probably not other OS)

TODO:
Change maze data type to be more efficient
Comment

ISSUES:
due to unicode character encoding, drawing solved maze doesn't work in ghci
